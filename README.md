A wind-activated digital musical instrument using the Arduino platform. A holistic approach to design was used incorporating industrial design, hardware layout, software coding and sound design. The hardware included a microcontroller, thermistor-based anemometer, audio/storage shield, external class D amplifier, integrated speaker and battery. Wind chime samples were edited from open source audio libraries and separated into bins of soft, medium and loud. Software was designed in concert with the audio design to randomly play soft samples at a shorter duration for lower wind speeds, medium samples at longer durations for higher wind speeds and so on. Hardware and software were housed in a custom built minimalist polycarbonate enclosure.
